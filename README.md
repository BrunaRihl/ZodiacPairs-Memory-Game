## Design

### Color palette

Selected a color palette with shades of gray, white, black, and blue to capture the atmosphere of a starry sky and convey the sensation of contemplating constellations. The tones were chosen with the purpose of reflecting the beauty and serenity of the night sky. The contrast between soft colors and darker tones not only evoked the shimmering effect of a starry sky but also contributed to creating a pleasant visual experience, aiding in reading and navigation on the website.
