## Design

### Color palette

Selected a color palette with shades of gray, white, black, and blue to capture the atmosphere of a starry sky and convey the sensation of contemplating constellations. The tones were chosen with the purpose of reflecting the beauty and serenity of the night sky. The contrast between soft colors and darker tones not only evoked the shimmering effect of a starry sky but also contributed to creating a pleasant visual experience, aiding in reading and navigation on the website.

### Typography 

Google Fonts was utilized to incorporate the selected font styles into the website. 

I chose the fonts 'Courier Prime' and 'Space Mono' for the website. 'Courier Prime' was selected for titles and subtitles due to its monospaced formatting, which brings a sense of order and uniformity. On the other hand, 'Space Mono', also monospaced, features a modern and futuristic style, aligning with the theme of constellations. Both fonts were chosen for their high readability, essential for presenting information accurately and accessibly. Their technical and futuristic styles seamlessly integrate with the theme of space and astrology.

### Imagery 

The selected images for the website aim to immerse users in the world of zodiac constellations. I made sure they were high-resolution, seamlessly blending with the colors and theme of the game. This includes a custom logo image and background visuals for the memory game cards. The goal was to provide an aesthetically cohesive and visually stimulating experience, ensuring that users feel connected to the celestial theme while engaging with the game.

### Wireframes

I developed a simple wireframe in PowerPoint for the game, aiming to ensure a consistent experience across mobile devices, computers, and tablets. I adjusted the size of buttons, texts, and cards, while maintaining the same layout for all cases. Later on, I made minor positioning adjustments and added some buttons to enhance functionality and user experience, ensuring the game is accessible and enjoyable on any platform.

## Features

The game website consists of only one initial page that starts with a header, buttons to access information about the game rules and the zodiac constellations, play and replay buttons, as well as a game status bar that is activated only when the player presses the "play" button. At this point, the game board with the cards is displayed. Additionally, there are three modal windows: one for the rules, another for game information, and a final one that is displayed when the game concludes.

## Background

I chose high-resolution images that were relevant to the theme of the game for the backgrounds. I ensured that, depending on the device's screen size - whether it's larger screens like computers or smaller screens like phones or tablets - different images were displayed to better fit the screen. This approach was adopted to enhance the visual experience regardless of the device used.
